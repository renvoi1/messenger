problems

the client needs to be able to send messages without having to wait
for the server to send one back, if we comment out the line of code that
tells the client to listen for a msg from the server, it doesnt work

i need to find a way to be able to listen on a different thread, so i can do
both thigns at once

so what i think i need to do is to move the line that allows the client to
listen to a different thread, and move the lines that allow the server to
send to a diff thread. how? idk, but ill figure it out. this program already
uses threading, just have to copy and paste it
